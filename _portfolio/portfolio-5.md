    1. Classification was assessed across six different convolutional neural networks with each network architecture paired with three different optimizers, namely, Adam, Adadelta and RMSprop
</p>
<p style="font-size:15px">
    2. Accuracy and loss for each network were observed in order to conclude better performing convolutional neural network
