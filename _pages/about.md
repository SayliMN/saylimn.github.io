<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:15px; margin-top:15px;">Hello! I am a data enthusiast with a deep-seated passion for the Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and biologically inspired approaches to AI. I envision creating an intelligent, evolving system that not only learns and adapts over time but also leverages its accumulated knowledge to master new tasks.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:15px;">I find joy in the simplicity of life, whether it's playing badminton, embracing nature, or the prospect of learning a new string instrument. My competitive spirit was honed through national and state-level competitions in jump rope, gymnastics, and fencing, teaching me the value of discipline and perseverance.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:15px;">Indoors, you'll catch me weaving magic in the kitchen while humming a tune, finding rhythm in the everyday. Beyond the world of algorithms and data, my spirit thrives on balance and exploration. Daily yoga and meditation ground me, allowing moments of calm and bliss to fuel my creativity and focus.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:15px;">In every facet of life, I seek new experiences, aiming to blend my love for innovation with a zest for exploration. Whether tackling complex problems or savoring the stillness of meditation, I believe in living fully, intensely, learning constantly, and laughing often.</p>
